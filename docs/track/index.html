                <h2>Outdoor Track</h2>
                <p>The NC Home Educators Athletic Commission (NCHEAC) is sponsoring track & field for the first time! We
                    are
                    going to have an official Cheetah track season from Feb 16th - ~May 2nd. It will be focused on
                    distance
                    running, for 10 year olds and up and will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons and vary locations
                    between Old Northern HS track, Guy B. Philips Middle school, and Blackwood Farm Park. Coaches will
                    be
                    Tim Williamson, Emily & Paul McCall, same as XC.
                </p>

                <p>This season is experimental for us and NCHEAC so some things aren't fully formed yet, but we can
                    promise high quality distance training and coaching, fun racing, and great friendships built through
                    working hard with others.
                </p>

                <h2>The Details</h2>

                <h3>When</h3>

                <p>Feb 16th - May 2 (I'd like to have HS go a week or two more, if we can find a good meet) Come the
                    first week to try it out, commitment on Feb 23rd. First meet is low-key and in Raleigh
                    on the 28th!
                </p>

                <h3>Who</h3>
                <p>Any homeschooler older than 10 years who lives a reasonable distance from Chapel Hill and is not a
                    current member of any other NCHEAC or school track team (club teams are okay, but let's discuss).
                    Athletes must be able to run 1mi (8 laps around a normal track) without stopping in under 13min
                    on flat ground by the end of week one. While we expect regular attendance, we don't take attendance
                    -
                    please understand that only those who have been running regularly will compete in meets.
                    All you need are a decent pair of running shoes, a yoga mat, a water bottle, and a good attitude!
                    A digital watch is encouraged but not required.
                </p>

                <h3>What we will have</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance focused (800/1600/3200) training that we can accommodate an early runner all the way to
                        national level competitors.</li>
                    <li>A handful of meets for both MS and HS, ranging from local all the way to state level, plus some
                        team time trials to prove out fitness and to learn to compete.</li>
                    <li>Three 75-90min team practices per week, focusing on building endurance and speed, working on
                        drills, plyometrics, and some core/stretching.</li>
                    <li>A weekly update email with a weekly training plan to help them train optimally the rest of the
                        week.</li>
                    <li>The ability to compete as a team, in uniform, against other homeschool teams, local schools, and
                        clubs.</li>
                    <li>The ability to compete in sprints and relays (even field events if they are properly trained).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p></p>

                <h3>What we won't have</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A dedicated home track. Locations will be Old Northern HS track to start, and then Guy B.
                        Phillips MS track,
                        plus Blackwood Farm Park on Wednesdays.</li>
                    <li>Sprint or field event training (but we'd love to have you on the team anyway if interested,
                        reach out!)</li>
                </ul>

                <p></p>
                <p>We won't be officially connected with Deerstream this season - but we have full support and blessing
                    from
                    them to run the program, and we expect to run the program with Deerstream next year (there is no
                    change for XC).
