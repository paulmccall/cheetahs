                <h2>Outdoor Track</h2>
                <p>The NC Home Educators Athletic Commission (NCHEAC) is sponsoring track & field for the first time! We
                    are going to have an official Cheetah track season from Feb 16th - ~May 2nd. It will be focused on
                    distance running, for 10 year olds and up and will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons and shift
                    locations between Old Northern HS track, Guy B. Philips Middle school, and Blackwood Farm Park. Coaches
                    are Tim Williamson, Emily & Paul McCall, same as XC.
                </p>

                <p>This season is experimental for us and NCHEAC so some things aren't fully formed yet, but we can
                    promise high quality distance training and coaching, fun racing, and great friendships built through
                    working hard with others.
                </p>

                <h2>The Details</h2>

                <h3>When</h3>

                <p>Feb 16th - May 2 (I'd like to have HS go a week or two more, if we can find a good meet) Come the
                    first week to try it out, commitment on Feb 23rd. First meet is low-key and in Raleigh
                    on the 28th!
                </p>

                <h3>Who</h3>
                <p>Any homeschooler older than 10 years who lives a reasonable distance from Chapel Hill and is not a
                    current member of any other NCHEAC or school track team (club teams are okay, but let's discuss).
                    Athletes must be able to run 1mi (8 laps around a normal track) without stopping in under 13min
                    on flat ground by the end of week one. While we expect regular attendance, we don't take attendance
                    -
                    please understand that only those who have been running regularly will compete in meets.
                    All you need are a decent pair of running shoes, a yoga mat, a water bottle, and a good attitude!
                    A digital watch is encouraged but not required.
                </p>

                <h3>What we have</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance focused (800/1600/3200) training that we can accommodate an early runner all the way to
                        national level competitors.</li>
                    <li>A handful of meets for both MS and HS, ranging from local all the way to state level, plus some
                        team time trials to prove out fitness and to learn to compete.</li>
                    <li>Three 75-90min team practices per week, focusing on building endurance and speed, working on
                        drills, plyometrics, and some core/stretching.</li>
                    <li>A weekly update email with a weekly training plan to help them train optimally the rest of the
                        week.</li>
                    <li>The ability to compete as a team, in uniform, against other homeschool teams, local schools, and
                        clubs.</li>
                    <li>The ability to compete in sprints and relays (even field events if they are properly trained).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p></p>

                <h3>What we are still working on</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A dedicated home track. Locations will shift between Old Northern HS track, Guy B.
                        Phillips MS track, and Blackwood Farm Park.</li>
                    <li>Sprint or field event training (but we'd love to have you on the team anyway if interested,
                        reach out!)</li>
                </ul>

                <p></p>

                <h2>About Practices</h2>

                <p>The season is short, but will be periodized to build aerobic stamina, build speed, improve running
                    efficiency, and finally peak for best performance at the end of the season.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We usually start practice with a 5-10min of easy running, followed by dynamic stretching, some
                    drills, strides, and/or plyometrics. We then do some sort of main interval workout, and end with a
                    5-10min cooldown. Less experienced runners may generally run 2-4 miles, while our top runners might
                    do 5-8 (It all depends on the practice). Young runners might start at 8 miles per week and build to
                    12, while top male HS runners could hit 50.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To succeed you will have to practice on your own in addition to team practices. You can follow the
                    suggested weekly practice schedule (always consider and adjust for health, experience, etc!). I
                    recommend that beginner runners run every other day - consistency is key, just keep the runs short
                    and easy. HS and experienced runners should run 5-6x per week, including a longer run on the weekend
                    if not racing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep easy running easy - conversational. Sleep, rest, and fuel well - remember that you don’t get
                    faster in practice - your body gets faster in response to practice, so help it succeed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will split the team into groups at practices based on the coaches discretion. Age, performance,
                    experience, injury history, maturity, safety, and event specificity all influence group placement.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Kids want to compete in practice - that competitive fire is great, but needs to be correctly
                    directed, and sometimes it isn’t the right time and place! Running hard all the time doesn’t make
                    you faster (long-term), and we don’t give awards for finishing first at practice. We do give smiles
                    and fist bumps for listening to coaches, working hard, and encouraging teammates though!
